# optimal_sensing_ELwing

Begin with wing_sensors_main.m  That script will simulate strain data from a flapping encode, encode strain information in spiking sensors, and use sparse sensor placement optimization for classification (SSPOC) to identify sensor locations.

The repository makes use of the cvx package, available from: http://cvxr.com/cvx/
