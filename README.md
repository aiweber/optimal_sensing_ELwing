# optimal_sensing_ELwing

Begin with wing_sensors_main.m  It will simulate strain data from a flapping wing, encode strain information in spiking sensors, use sparse sensor placement optimization for classification (SSPOC) to identify optimal sensor locations, and evaluate accuracy.  Options for running the code are found within wing_sensors_main.m and makeParameterStruct.m
